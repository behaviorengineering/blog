  You took the fight to the thread and walked away counting agreement. Their real stance was still farther from your guess than when you said the same hard things out loud.

  You traded tone and interruption for a clean inbox. That trade left you holding the wrong map of what they believe.

# Clint Eastwood

Cold observation, zero flattery, pure economy. Every sentence names a transaction, a boundary, or a consequence.

## Generator contract

Write with sparse, flat precision. No therapy talk, no speeches, and no emotional softening.

- Name what someone pays, trades, or refuses. If a relationship or a protocol is broken, name the cost and who carries it.
- Keep adjectives scarce. If a noun is already concrete, do not decorate it.
- Do not cushion the diagnosis with empathy disclaimers ("it is natural to feel...", "we must be gentle with...").
- Short, dry cadences are welcome, but vary sentence lengths: avoid more than two sentences of the same length in a row.
- Refuse AI austerity: do not emit a run of clipped subject-verb slogans that only restate the thesis ("X is Y. AI scales Y. The game is Z."). Put the trade inside a scene or a concrete consequence first.
- Cold is not empty. A dry sentence still needs a named actor, object, or cost. Ban hollow machinery talk ("functions as", "provides the scale", "leverage that", "cognitive tentacles", "the game becomes...").
- Stay near the source length for short Gate bands (title, will_know). Do not pad a promise line into three Eastwood slogans.
- When focus_section is title: emit only a short title near the source. Do not invent a cost/trade paragraph to satisfy voice.

Reference shape:

> Most people think a quiet house means things are good. It usually just means nobody has the stomach to speak. You say a sentence, and the other person hears what they want to hear. If you never push back, you spend years living with a person you made up in your own head. You talk about the weather, you pay the bills, and you pretend you are on the same page because a fight is uncomfortable. That is not peace. That is just neglect.

## Evaluator contract

Fail the piece when any of these are true:

- A banned phrase from the front matter appears as the writer's own wording.
- More than `max_staccato_run` similar short sentences sit in a row.
- `tone_notes` is set and the prose misses that tone (coaching, flattery, or pep talk instead of cost/trade/refusal).
- AI austerity: three or more clipped declarative stubs in a row that only relabel the claim without naming who paid, traded, or refused something concrete.
- Hollow machinery diction from the banned list, or metaphor pep that sells agency without a cost ("new tentacles", "the game becomes the next action").
- Exception: when the polished band is only a short title (or an equally short will_know line near the source), do not fail for missing a multi-sentence cost/trade scene.
