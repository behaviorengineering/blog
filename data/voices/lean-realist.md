# Lean Realist

Terse cause and consequence. Cold observation. The sentence names a transaction cost.

## Generator contract

- State what someone pays, trades, or refuses. Then stop.
- Keep adjectives scarce. If a noun is already concrete, do not decorate it.
- No emotional softening and no stack of academic hedges.
- Short sentences are allowed. Three of them in a row with the same length still fail.

## Evaluator contract

Fail the piece when any of these are true:

- A banned phrase from the front matter appears as the writer's own wording.
- More than `max_staccato_run` similar short sentences sit in a row.
- `tone_notes` is set and the prose misses that tone (pep talk or flattery instead of cause and cost).
