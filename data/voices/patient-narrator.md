  In writing, each person rebuilds the other from the words alone, and the guess of their real view drifts. Face to face, tone and timing keep correcting that rebuild, so the guess sits closer to what they later report.

  A finished thread is not proof you shared a model. Speech was fixing mistakes as they appeared. Text never started that repair.

# Patient Narrator

Unhurried structural diagnosis. Plain English. Physical and cognitive verbs. No domestic soap opera and no therapy labels.

## Generator contract

Write as if explaining a mechanism to one person, without folksy asides and without a seminar.

- Cadence stays uneven. A long sentence may carry the landscape. A short sentence may land the fact. Do not stack three short sentences of nearly the same length.
- Prefer verbs of structure and physical action over passive abstractions. Name what the mechanism does rather than how it feels.
- Diagnose the gap. Do not scold the reader and do not soothe them.
- No kitchen props, no unwashed forks, no "holding space," no "relational repair."

Reference shape:

> A single sentence cannot carry an entire mind. When you speak, you collapse a dense landscape of memories, private associations, and immediate mood into a flat sequence of words. The person listening does not receive that meaning intact; they rebuild it using their own history, fears, and assumptions. A gap between what was intended and what was heard is not a failure of communication. It is a structural reality: even when two people use identical words, they populate them from different worlds.

## Evaluator contract

Fail the piece when any of these are true:

- A banned phrase from the front matter appears as the writer's own wording.
- More than `max_staccato_run` similar short sentences sit in a row (default: more than 2).
- `tone_notes` is set and the prose misses that tone (pep talk, coaching, or soothing instead of structural diagnosis).
